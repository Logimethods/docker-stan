NATS Streaming provides the following high-level feature set.
- Log based.
- At-Least-Once Delivery model, giving reliable message delivery.
- Rate matched on a per subscription basis.
- Replay/Restart
- Last Value Semantics

### Getting Started

The best way to get the NATS Streaming Server is to use one of the pre-built release binaries which are available for OSX, Linux (x86-64/ARM), Windows. Instructions for using these binaries are on the GitHub releases page.

Of course you can build the latest version of the server from the master branch. The master branch will always build and pass tests, but may not work correctly in your environment. You will first need Go installed on your machine (version 1.5+ is required) to build the NATS server.

See also the NATS Streaming Quickstart [tutorial](https://nats.io/documentation/streaming/nats-streaming-quickstart/).

### Running

The NATS Streaming Server embeds a NATS Server. Starting the server with no argument will give you a server with default settings and a memory based store.

```
> ./nats-streaming-server
[73781] 2016/06/20 21:06:52.753188 [INF] Starting nats-streaming-server[test-cluster] version 0.0.1.alpha
[73781] 2016/06/20 21:06:52.754773 [INF] Starting nats-server version 0.8.2
[73781] 2016/06/20 21:06:52.754782 [INF] Listening for client connections on localhost:4222
[73781] 2016/06/20 21:06:52.757134 [INF] Server is ready
[73781] 2016/06/20 21:06:53.094875 [INF] STAN: Message store is MEMORY
[73781] 2016/06/20 21:06:53.094887 [INF] STAN: Maximum of 1000000 will be stored
```

The server will be started and listening for client connections on port 4222 (the default) from all available interfaces. The logs will be displayed to stderr as shown above.

Note that you do not need to start the embedded NATS Server. It is started automatically when you run the NATS Streaming Server. See below for details on how you secure the embedded NATS Server.

## Securing NATS Streaming Server

### Authorization

If you use basic authorization, that is a single user defined through the configuration file or command line parameters, nothing else is required. The embedded NATS Server is started with those credentials and the NATS Streaming Server uses them.

However, if you define multiple users, then you **must** specify the username and password (or token) corresponding to the NATS Streaming Server's user.

For instance, suppose that your configuration file `server.cfg` has the following content:

```
listen: 127.0.0.1:4233
http: 127.0.0.1:8233

authorization {
    users = [
      {user: alice, password: foo}
      {user: bob,   password: bar}
    ]
}
```
and you start the NATS Streaming Server this way:
```sh
nats-streaming-server -config server.cfg
```
then the server would fail to start. You **must** specify the user used by the streaming server. For instance:
```sh
nats-streaming-server -config server.cfg -user alice -pass foo
```

### TLS

While there are several TLS related parameters to the streaming server, securing the NATS Streaming server's connection is straightforward when you bear in mind that the relationship between the NATS Streaming server and the embedded NATS server is a client server relationship.  To state simply, the streaming server is a client of it's embedded NATS server.

That means two sets of TLS configuration parameters must be used:  TLS server parameters for the embedded NATS server, and TLS client parameters for the streaming server itself.

The streaming server specifies it's TLS client certificates with the following three parameters:
    -tls_client_key              Client key for the streaming server

    -tls_client_cert             Client certificate for the streaming server

    -tls_client_cacert           Client certificate CA for the streaming server

These could be the same certificates used with your NATS streaming clients.

The embedded NATS server specifies TLS server certificates with these:

        --tlscert <file>             Server certificate file

        --tlskey <file>              Private key for server certificate

        --tlscacert <file>           Client certificate CA for verification

The server parameters are used the same way you would secure a typical NATS server. See [here](https://github.com/nats-io/gnatsd#securing-nats).

Proper usage of the NATS Streaming Server requires the use of both client and server parameters.

e.g.:

```sh
nats-streaming-server -tls_client_cert client-cert.pem -tls_client_key client-key.pem -tls_client_cacert ca.pem -tlscert server-cert.pem -tlskey server-key.pem -tlscacert ca.pem
```

Further TLS related functionality can be found in [usage](https://github.com/nats-io/gnatsd#securing-nats), and should specifying cipher suites be required, a configuration file for the embedded NATS server can be passed through the `-config` command line parameter.

## Persistence

By default, the NATS Streaming Server stores its state in memory, which means that if the streaming server is stopped, all state is lost. Still, this level of persistence allows applications to stop and later resume the stream of messages, and protect against applications disconnect (network or applications crash).

### File Store

For a higher level of message delivery, the server should be configured with a file store. NATS Streaming Server comes with a basic file store implementation. Various file store implementations may be added in the future.

To start the server with a file store, you need to provide two parameters:

```sh
nats-streamin-server -store file -dir datastore
```
The parameter `-store` indicates what type of store to use, in this case `file`. The other (`-dir`) indicates in which directory the state should be stored.

The first time the server is started, it will create two files in this directory, one containing some server related information (`server.dat`) another to record clients information (`clients.dat`).

When a streaming client connects, it uses a client identification, which the server registers in this file. When the client disconnects, the client is cleared from this file.

When the client publishes or subscribe to a new subject (also called channel), the server creates a sub-directory whose name is the subject. For instance, if the client subscribes to `foo`, and assuming that you started the server with `-dir datastore`, then you will find a directory called `datastore/foo`. In this directory you will find several files: one to record subscriptions information (`subs.dat`), and a serie of files that logs the messages `msgs.1.dat`, etc...

The number of sub-directories, which again correspond to channels, can be limited by the configuration parameter `-max_channels`. When the limit is reached, any new subscription or message published on a new channel will produce an error.

On a given channel, the number of subscriptions can also be limited with the configuration parameter `-max_subs`. A client that tries to create a subscription on a given channel (subject) for which the limit is reached will receive an error.

Finally, the number of stored messages for a given channel can also be limited with the parameter `-max_msgs` and/or `-max_bytes`. However, for messages, the client does not get an error when the limit is reached. The oldest messages are discarded to make room for the new messages.

### Store Interface

Every store implementation follows the [Store interface](https://github.com/nats-io/nats-streaming-server/blob/master/stores/store.go).

The main interace is the `Store` which the server will create a unique instance of. From a store, the server can add/delete clients, create/lookup channels, etc...

Creating/looking up a channel will return a `ChannelStore`, which points to two other interfaces, the `SubStore` and `MsgStore`. These stores handle, for a given channel, subscriptions and messages respectiverly.

If you wish to contribute to a new store type, your implementation must include all these interfaces. For stores that allow recovery (such as file store as opposed to memory store), there are additional structures that have been defined and that a store constructor should return. This allows the server to reconstruct its state on startup.

The memory and the provided file store implementations both use a generic store implementation to avoid code duplication.
When writing your own store implementation, you can do the same for APIs that don't need to do more than what the generic implementation provides.
You can check [MemStore](https://github.com/nats-io/nats-streaming-server/blob/master/stores/memstore.go) and [FileStore](https://github.com/nats-io/nats-streaming-server/blob/master/stores/filestore.go) implementations for more details.

## Building

Building the NATS Streaming Server from source requires at least version 1.5 of Go, but we encourage the use of the latest stable release. Information on installation, including pre-built binaries, is available at http://golang.org/doc/install. Stable branches of operating system packagers provided by your OS vendor may not be sufficient.

Run `go version` to see the version of Go which you have installed.

Run `go get` inside the directory to include all possible dependencies.

Run `go build` inside the directory to build.

Run `go test ./...` to run the unit regression tests.

A successful build produces no messages and creates an executable called `nats-streaming-server` in the current directory. You can invoke that binary, with no options and no configuration file, to start a server with acceptable standalone defaults (no authentication, memory store).

Run go help for more guidance, and visit http://golang.org/ for tutorials, presentations, references and more.

## Clients

Currently, there are two NATS Streaming clients, both supported by Apcera. We will be adding additional supported streaming clients in the future, and encourage community-contributed clients.
